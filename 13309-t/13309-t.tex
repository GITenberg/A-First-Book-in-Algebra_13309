\section*{PREFACE}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{\numberline{}Preface}

In preparing this book, the author had especially in mind classes
in the upper grades of grammar schools, though the work will be
found equally well adapted to the needs of any classes of
beginners.

The ideas which have guided in the treatment of the subject are
the following: The study of algebra is a continuation of what the
pupil has been doing for years, but it is expected that this new
work will result in a knowledge of \textit{ general truths} about
numbers, and an increased power of clear thinking. All the
differences between this work and that pursued in arithmetic may
be traced to the introduction of two new elements, namely,
negative numbers and the representation of numbers by letters. The
solution of problems is one of the most valuable portions of the
work, in that it serves to develop the thought-power of the pupil
at the same time that it broadens his knowledge of numbers and
their relations. Powers are developed and habits formed only by
persistent, long-continued practice.

Accordingly, in this book, it is taken for granted that
the pupil knows what he may be reasonably expected to
have learned from his study of arithmetic; abundant
practice is given in the representation of numbers by
letters, and great care is taken to make clear the meaning
of the minus sign as applied to a single number,
together with the modes of operating upon negative numbers;
problems are given in every exercise in the book;
and, instead of making a statement of what the child is
to see in the illustrative example, questions are asked
which shall lead him to find for himself that which he
is to learn from the example.

\textbf{ 1.} Algebra is so much like arithmetic that all that you
know about addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division,
the signs that you have been using and the ways of working out
problems, will be very useful to you in this study. There are two
things the introduction of which really makes all the difference
between arithmetic and algebra. One of these is the use of
\textit{ letters to represent numbers}, and you will see in the
following exercises that this change makes the solution of
problems much easier.

\subsubsection*{Exercise I.}

\textit{ Illustrative Example}. The sum of two numbers is 60, and
the
greater is four times the less. What are the numbers?\\

\begin{center}
\textbf{ Solution}.\\

\text{then } &$4x$ & \text{ the greater number,}\\
\text{and }  &$4x + x$ & 60,\\
\text{or }   &$5x$ & 60; \\
\text{therefore } &$x$ & 12,\\
\text{and }    &$4x$ & 48. \text{ The numbers are 12 and 48.}

We find a difficulty in solving this last example, because we do
not know just how large $x, b, m, y$, and $z$ are with reference
to each other. This is only one example of a large class of
problems which may arise, in which we find direction east and
west, north and south; space before and behind, to the right and
to the left, above and below; time past and future; money gained
and lost; everywhere these opposite relations. This relation of
oppositeness must be expressed in some way in our representation
of numbers.

In algebra, therefore, numbers are considered as increasing from
zero in opposite directions. Those in one direction are called
Positive Numbers (or + numbers); those in the other direction
Negative Numbers (or - numbers).

In Illus. 4, if we call direction east positive, then direction
west will be negative, and the respective distances that the man
traveled will be $+x, - b, + m, + y$, and $-z$. Combining these,
the answer to the problem becomes $x - b + m + y - z$. If the same
analysis be applied to Illus. 3, we get 15 - 30 + 20 + 5 - 6 = +4,
or 4 miles north of starting-point.

\textbf{\textit{ The minus sign before a single number makes the
number negative, and shows that the number has a subtractive
relation to any other to which it may be united, and that it will
diminish that number by its value. It shows a relation rather than
an operation.}}

\textit{Negative numbers} are the second of the two things
referred to on page 7, the introduction of which makes all the
difference between arithmetic and algebra.

NOTE.---Negative numbers are usually spoken of as less than zero,
because they are used to represent losses. To illustrate: suppose
a man's money affairs be such that his debts just equal his
assets, we say that he is worth nothing. Suppose now that the sum
of his debts is \$1000 greater than his total assets. He is worse
off than by the first supposition, and we say that he is worth
less than nothing. We should represent his property by $-1000$
(dollars).

How do these terms compare with reference to degree? They are
called \textit{homogeneous} terms.

What are homogeneous terms?

\[

A \textbf{monomial} is an algebraic expression of one term.

A \textbf{polynomial} is an algebraic expression of more
than one term.

A polynomial of two terms is called a \textbf{binomial}, and
one of three terms is called a \textbf{trinomial}.

The \textbf{degree of an algebraic expression} is the same
as the degree of its highest term. What is the degree
of each of the polynomials above? What is a homogeneous
polynomial?

In arithmetic you learned that multiplication is the addition of
equal numbers, that the multiplicand expresses one of those equal
numbers, and the multiplier the number of them. In algebra we have
negative as well as positive numbers. Let us see the effect of
this in multiplication. We have four possible cases.

\begin{enumerate}

\item Multiplication of a plus number by a plus number.

\begin{tabular}{ccc}
& $+7$&\\
ILLUS. &$\underline{+ 4}$& This must mean \textit{four sevens}, or
28.
\end{tabular}

\item Multiplication of a minus number by a plus number.

\begin{tabular}{ccc}
&$-7$ &\\
ILLUS. &$\underline{+ 4}$ &This must mean \textit{four
minus-sevens}, or $-
28$.\\
\end{tabular}

\item Multiplication of a plus number by a minus number.

\begin{tabular}{ccl}
&$+7$&\\
ILLUS. &$\underline{- 4}$ &\\
\end{tabular}
This must mean the opposite of what $+4$ meant as a multiplier.
Plus four meant add, minus four must mean subtract.
\textit{Subtracting four sevens} gives $-28$.

\item Multiplication of a minus number by a minus number.

\begin{tabular}{ccl}
&$-7$&\\

ILLUS. &$\underline{-4}$& This must mean \textit{subtract four
minus-sevens}, or 28.

Why stop the work at the point given? What is the complete
quotient? Is the dividend exactly divisible by the divisor? When
is one number exactly divisible by another?

\footnotetext{It would be well for the teacher to work out this
example on the board with the class along the line of the
questions which follow the example.}

\textit{ To divide a polynomial by a polynomial, arrange the terms
of the dividend, and divisor similarly, divide the first term of
the dividend by the first term of the divisor for the first term
of the quotient, multiply the divisor by the quotient and subtract
the product from the dividend; divide the first term of the
remainder by the first term of the divisor for the next term of
the quotient, multiply and subtract as before; continue this work
of dividing, multiplying, and subtracting until there is no
remainder or until the first term of the remainder is not
divisible by the first term of the divisor.}

\textbf{23}. When we divide a number into two numbers,
which multiplied together will give a product equal to
the given number, we have found the factors of that
number. This process is called \textbf{factoring}.

Name two factors of 48, 27, 18, 35, 49, 72.

Name three factors of 24, 100, 75, 64, 72, 40.


\textbf{24. CASE I. To factor a polynomial which has
a factor common to all its terms}.

\begin{tabular}{ll}

Sometimes a polynomial in the form given has no
factor common to all its terms, but has factors common
to several terms. It may be possible then to
group the terms in parentheses so that there will be
a binomial or trinomial factor common to all the terms
of the polynomial in its new form.

\textbf{ 36.} What is the effect of multiplying a number twice by
$-1$? How many signs to a fraction?

Note carefully in the following illustrations the variety of
changes that may be made in the signs without changing the value
of the fraction:

ILLUS. 1.
\[
\frac{a}{b}=\frac{-a}{-b}=-\frac{-a}{b}=-\frac{a}{-b}.
\]

In case the terms of the fraction are polynomials, notice that the
change in sign affects every term of the numerator or denominator.

ILLUS. 2.
\[
\frac{a-b}{x-y}=\frac{b-a}{y-x}=-\frac{b-a}{x-y}=-\frac{a-b}{y-x}.
\]

ILLUS. 3.
\[
\frac{a-b+c}{x+y+z}=\frac{b-c-a}{-x-y-z}=-\frac{b-c-a}{x+y+z}\\
=-\frac{a-b+c}{-x-y-z}
\]

When the denominator of the fraction is expressed in its factors,
the variety of changes is increased.

ILLUS. 4.
\begin{align*}
\frac{a}{(x-y)(m-n)} =& \frac{a}{(y-x)(n-m)} = \frac{-a}{(y-x)(m-n)} \\
                     =& \frac{-a}{(x-y)(n-m)} = \frac{-a}{(x-y)(m-n)} \\
                     =& \frac{a}{(y-x)(m-n)} =\frac{a}{(y-x)(n-m)} \\
\end{align*}

ILLUS. 5.

\begin{align*}
\frac{a-b}{(x-y)(c-d)}&= \frac{b-a}{(y-x)(c-d)} = \frac{a-b}{(y-x)(d-c)}\\
&= -\frac{a-b}{(y-x)(c-d)} = \textrm{etc.}
\end{align*}

What is the effect on the value of a fraction of changing the
signs of two factors of either denominator or numerator? Why? If
the signs of only one factor of the denominator are changed, what
must be done to keep the value of the fraction the same?

Write three equivalent fractions for each of the following by
means of a change in the signs:

\begin{enumerate}

\item $\displaystyle \frac{x+y}{a-b}$

\item $\displaystyle \frac{x}{(a-b)(m-n)}$

\item $\displaystyle \frac{3a^2bc}{(2x-y)(a-z)}$

\item $\displaystyle \frac{a-m}{(c-d)(x-y)}$

\item $\displaystyle \frac{2c+d}{(a-b+c)(x-z)}$

Write as many equivalent fractions as possible for
each of the following:

\item $\displaystyle \frac{c}{(a-b)(x-y)(m-n)}$

\item $\displaystyle \frac{a}{(c-d)(m-x)(y-b)}$

\item $\displaystyle \frac{a^2x}{(2m-n)(c-x)(d-y^2)}$

\item $\displaystyle \frac{(x-y)(2a-b)}{(m-x)(a-c)(d-y)}$

ILLUS. 2. Find the value of $\frac{1}{(a-b)(b-c)} + \frac{1}{(b-a)(a-c)} + \frac{1}{(c-a)(c-b)}$.

\[
\begin{array}{c}

\displaystyle = \frac{1}{(a-b)(b-c)} - \frac{1}{(a-b)(a-c)} + \frac{1}{(a-c)(b-c)}\\
\displaystyle = \frac{a-c}{(a-b)(b-c)(a-c)} - \frac{b-c}{(a-b)(b-c)(a-c)} + \frac{a-b}{(a-b)(b-c)(a-c)}\\

An \textbf{equation} is an expression of the equality of two
numbers. The parts of the expression separated by the
sign of equality are called the \textbf{members} of the equation.

The last letters of the alphabet are used to represent
unknown numbers, and known numbers are represented by
figures or by the first letters of the alphabet.

(1) Let $AM$ and $AH$ in all the figures denote the positions

  &MX &=& MH + HX.   \\
  & x &=& 5 + \frac{x}{12}. \text{  Solution gives } x=5\frac{5}{11}.

4x-y=7, & y=5 \end{array} \right\} \textrm{ in both equations. }
\]

\textbf{Simultaneous equations} are equations in which the
same unknown numbers have the same value.

One equation containing more than one unknown
number cannot be solved. There must be as many
simultaneous equations as there are unknown numbers.

\[
 \textrm{ILLUS. 1.  Solve} \left\{ \begin{array}{c} x + 3y = 17,\\
2x+y=9. \end{array} \right.
\]

Multiply the first equation by 2;

\[
 \left. \begin{array}{cc} \textrm{then} & 2x + 6y = 34, \\
\textrm{but} & \underline{2x+y=9}\\
\textrm{  Subtracting, } & 5y=25\\
& y=5. \end{array} \right.
\]

To find the value of $x$, substitute the value of $y$ in the
second equation:

\[
2x + 5 = 9, 2x = 4, x = 2.
\]

\[
 Ans. \left\{ \begin{array}{l} x = 2,\\
y=5 \end{array} \right.
\]

\[
 \textrm{ILLUS. 2.  Solve} \left\{ \begin{array}{c} 3x + 4y = 12,\\
5x - 6y=1. \end{array} \right.
\]

Multiply the first equation by 3, and the second equation
by 2,

\[ \begin{array}{l rrr l}
                &  9x & {}+ 12y = & 36   \\
                & 10x & {}- 12y = &  2   \\
\cline{2-4} \text{Adding, } & 19x &           & 38 & \therefore x
= 2.
\end{array}
\]

Substituting, $6 + 4y = 12$, $4y = 6$, $y = 1\frac{1}{2}$.

\textit{Multiply one or both of the equations by such a number
that one of the unknown numbers shall have like coefficients. If
the signs of the terms having like coefficients are alike,
subtract one equation from the other; if unlike, add the
equations}.

A \textbf{ quadratic equation} is an equation in which, the
highest power of the unknown number is a square. It is called an
equation of the second degree.

If it contains only the second power of the unknown number (Illus.
1), it is called a \textbf{ pure quadratic equation}. If it
contains both the first and second powers of the unknown number
(Illus. 2), it is called an \textbf{ affected quadratic equation}.

\textbf{ 50}. ILLUS. Solve $x^2-\frac{x^2-10}{3} =
35-\frac{x^2+50}{5}$.
\begin{align}
15x^2-5x^2+50 &= 525-3x^2-150.\\
        13x^2 &= 325.\\
          x^2 &= 25.\\
            x &= {\pm}5.
\end{align}

\textit{ To solve a pure quadratic equation, reduce to the form
$x^2 = a$ and take the square root of each member}.

The above method of solving affected quadratic equations is the
simplest of three methods commonly used, and will not solve all
possible cases; the method given for solving simultaneous
equations is only one of three known methods; the cases in
factoring are less than half of those usually taken. In fact, we
have made only a beginning in the subject of algebra; much more
lies ahead along the lines which we have been following. \textit{
Can you grasp more clearly the conditions given in any problem
presented to you, and see more definitely just what is required,
than when you began this study? Do you possess greater ability to
think out problems? Has the use of letters to represent numbers
made you think more exactly what is to be done, and what the
operations mean?} If so, your knowledge of numbers is broader, and
you already know that

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project

"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
